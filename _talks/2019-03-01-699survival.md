Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a type of cancer that affects cells in the bone marrow.  Half a million people aroundthe world in 2015 suffers from the disease.  Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) is a common treatment ofthe disease but as any other surgery it puts patients in risk while receiving it.  It is of interest to investigate the effectiveness of this treatment under some specific circumstances.  Using Cox proportional hazards models and estimate that patients that received ASCT treatment and relapse in the disease have a decrease of 10% in the hazard ratio of MM than patients that relapse without receiving ASCT. Also, we found evidence that receiving a second ASCT could increase the hazard ratio of MM.
