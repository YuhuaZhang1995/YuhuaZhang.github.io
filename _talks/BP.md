In this project, we aim to estabilish the long term relationship between the mal-adaptive styles and the disease course of bipolar order. We collected data from 787 bipolar disorder patients over 10 years. A Poisson Regression model is fitted to estimate the correlation between the outcome variables and the personality styles.
