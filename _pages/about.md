I am Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/). I work with [Dr Zöllner](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/zollner-sebastian.html) in statistical genetics, and with [Dr Boonstra](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/boonstra-philip.html) in data integration methods. 

I am also one of the co-founders of "Mexicanos en Estadística y Salud," a group of Mexican researchers who does science communication (check out more [here]( https://mxciencia.github.io)). 

Before, I completed a MS in the Department of Statistics at The Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT), advised by Professor Miguel Nakamura. I received a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM).

I live in Ann Arbor with my wife and two kids (soon to be three). I am always happy to connect with people from all stages of their careers about collaborations, networking, or mentoring. Please shoot me an email anytime!
