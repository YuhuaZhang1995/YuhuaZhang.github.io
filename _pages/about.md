I am currently writing my Ph.D. dissertation under Dr Sebastian Zöllner in the transferability of polygenic risk scores. I expect to graduate from mid to end of 2022. I am also involved in research about data integration methods with Dr Phillip Boonstra. I am also one of the co-founders of "Mexicanos en Estadística y Salud," a research group of young Mexican researchers who writes about science communication (check out more here https://mxciencia.github.io). I live in Ann Arbor with my wife and two kids (soon to be three). I am always happy to connect with people from all stages of their careers about collaborations, networking, or mentoring. Please shoot me an email anytime!
