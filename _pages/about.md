I am currently writting my PhD dissertation under the guidance of Dr Sebastian Zöllner in the transferability of polygenic risk scores, I expect to graduate mid to end of 2022. I am also involve in researcg about data integration methods with Dr Phillip Boonstra. I am also one of the co-founders of "Mexicanos en Estadística y Salud", which is a research group of young Mexican researchers that writes about science communication (check out more here https://mxciencia.github.io). I live in Ann Arbor with my wife and two kids (soon to be three). I am always happy to connect with people in all their stages of their careers about collaborations, networking or mentoring. Shoot me an email anytime! 

A personal thought about inclusive teaching
======
I had a very interesting talk about today with a peer. It sparked on me the idea of inclusive teaching. What I mean by that is that an inclusive teacher must develop many channels for students to participate in class. Only having one channel will benefit more those students that feel comfortable participating through that channel. This is something I think is getting more common, specially with the increase of techonology. Now you can reach out professors through various methods and is not uncommon for them to hae several of them available to students. However, I am wondering about how can a teacher/professor evaluate students in a diverse way so that every student gets evaluated in a way that their strenghts are shown more than their weakness. In all, so that grades reflect the best of all students and not just how well they can perform in an specific way. This is a tough one, I don't have an answer, if you do please share it!
