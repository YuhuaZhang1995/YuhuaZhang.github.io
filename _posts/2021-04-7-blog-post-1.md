A conversation that made me think
======
I had a fascinating talk today with a peer that sparked in me the idea of inclusive teaching. I mean that an inclusive teacher must develop many channels for students to participate in class. Only having one channel will benefit more those students that feel comfortable participating through that channel. This face of inclusive teaching is getting more common, especially with the increase of technology. Now you can reach out to professors through various methods, and it is not uncommon for them to have several of them available to students. However, I wonder how a teacher/professor can diversely evaluate students so that every student gets assessed so that their strengths shine more than their weaknesses. In all, so that grades reflect the best of all students and not just how well they can perform in a specific way. 

This is a tough one. I don't have an answer. If you do, please share it!
