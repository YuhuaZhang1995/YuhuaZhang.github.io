An excellent documentary 
======
I recently watched the documentary Picture a Scientist (https://www.pictureascientist.com). It is about the invisible (and often very visible) barriers that women have when they go into scientific careers.
After watching it I was shocked, but not surprised, about the stories and aweful situations most if not all women have to endure. 
However, at this is not a critic of the documentary, I was also left with the question. What should we do? How do we solve this? What are the short, medium and long term actions that we have to take as a society?
I don't know, but I hope there is plenty of research about it. I'll look into it. For the moment I'm looking forward for the pannel discussion the School of Public Health at Michigan is going to have on the topic.
