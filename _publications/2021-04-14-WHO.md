The WHO comissioned the Institute for Global Health Sciences a report on the response of Mexico to the pandemic.
In Chapter 5: Public Health Response of the [report](https://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/sites/globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/files/mexico-covid-19-case-study-english.pdf) there is an explanation of who the Mexican gobernment adapted the Sentinel Surveillance system for the pandemic.
In that section our [article](https://datos.nexos.com.mx/descifrando-el-modelo-centinela/) about the Sentinel Model is cited and one of our figures adapted and included in the report. 
It is great to see the hard work we put into that piece being useful for other researchers.
