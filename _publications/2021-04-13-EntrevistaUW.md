All members of "Mexicanos en Estad√≠stica y Salud" are going to be interviewed by the Biostatistics Department of the University of Washington.
I'm looking forward to it and I still don't know what is the interview exactly about. 
But I think is to tell a little bit about our journey as a SciCom group. 
I'm really proud of being a member of this extraordinary group of young researchers and I have a lot of faith in the things we will accomplish.
